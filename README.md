# Guidelines for Hacktoberfest 2020:
## About Hacktoberfest:

Hacktoberfest is organised by DigitalOcean in partnership with Dev & Intel. It is a month-long celebration of open-source software. Maintainers are invited to guide the contributors who would like to work in the issues so that the project gets better, and contributors get the opportunity to give back to both projects they like and others they've just discovered. No contribution is too small — bug fixes and documentation updates are valid ways of participating.

**Disclaimer: "Quality matters not quantity."**
*For more informations and resources do check:* [Hacktoberfest](https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/details).
## RULES :

- *Hacktoberfest* is open to everyone. Whether you’re a seasoned contributor or looking for projects to contribute to for the first time, you’re welcome to participate.

- Pull requests can be made in any participating GitHub-hosted repositories/projects.

- Maintainers can opt-in to participate by classifying their projects with the hacktoberfest topic.

- Your pull requests will count toward your participation if they are in a repository with the **hacktoberfest** topic and once they have been merged, approved by a maintainer or labelled as *hacktoberfest-accepted*.

- Additionally, any pull request with the **hacktoberfest-accepted** label, submitted to any public GitHub repository, with or without the hacktoberfest topic, will be considered valid for Hacktoberfest.

- You can sign up anytime between October 1 and October 31. Just be sure to sign up on the official Hacktoberfest website for your pull requests to count.

- ***Pull requests prior to the rule change on October 3, 2020 at 12:00:00 UTC can be to any public repository on GitHub, not just the ones highlighted.***

- Pull requests following the rule change must be to a participating public repository on GitHub, and have been merged, labelled as hacktoberfest-accepted, or approved.

- Pull requests labelled as hacktoberfest-accepted will count toward to Hacktoberest from any public repository on GitHub, with or without the hacktoberfest topic.

**The pull request must contain commits you made yourself. If a maintainer reports your pull request as spam, it will not be counted toward your participation in Hacktoberfest. If a maintainer reports behaviour that’s not in line with the values of Hacktoberfest or the project’s code of conduct, you will be ineligible to participate. This year, the first 70,000 participants can earn a T-shirt or plant a tree.**
